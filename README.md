# Advent of Code 2020

This repo contains my solutions to the advent of code 2020 using Python 3.8

For many of the earlier challenges I've prioritised one-line solutions because I enjoy it and it encourages me to use more interesting parts of the standard library. The code is bad, I know.

## Setup
To install requirements to your virtual environment, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Running tests
I've used `pytest` as my test runner for the advent of code this year.

To run all unit tests, run `pytest`

To run unit tests for a specific day, run `pytest day_XX`

## Running solutions on input files
To run the solution file for a given day's input file, run `python day_XX/solution.py`
